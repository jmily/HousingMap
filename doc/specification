Housing affordability is declining in Australia. According to the Reserve Bank, over the past 30 years, the ratio of housing prices to income has increased substantially. [source: http://www.rba.gov.au/speeches/2009/sp-so-260309.html] This project aims to develop a new tool to measure housing + transport affordability in Australia, with greater Melbourne selected as the pilot study area.

How is affordability measured?

Housing affordability is traditionally measured using the percentage of income spent on housing costs. As a common rule, households who spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs while earning in the bottom 40% of the income range are considered to be under housing stress. An important cost that is usually overlooked in measuring affordability is the transport or accessibility costs.

Need for an “open” online tool to offer personalised affordability index in Australia

Currently, there is no publicly available tool in Australia to visualise and communicate the combined housing and transport affordability, supporting decision making by citizens, planners, and policy-makers.

The new online tool provides benefit to regional planning, state, and municipal policy development, siting of affordable housing, transport planning, scenario evaluation, affordability awareness, and homebuyer counseling. The new tool will help improving capacity to plan integrated growing cities, contributing to well-being and social inclusion.

H+T INDEX section includes three parts
HOUSING COSTS:
Median monthly mortgage repayments
Median monthly rent
TRANSPORT COSTS:
Vehicle ownership costs
Vehicle use costs
Public transit use costs
Time spent in commuting
H+T AFFORDABILITY
Total housing costs over income
Total transport costs over income
Housing + Transport costs over income
Then put a map of Melbourne from Google/Openstreetmap. We will then update the map with a Mapbox visualization.

FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES sections includes the following text.

We are seeking $200,000 for a period of two years to conduct the proposed project. Monash University has already invested an initial seed funding of about $16,000 in the project. Funding will be used to support PhD student(s) and Research Fellow(s) for relevant research and development activities.

If you or your organisation is interested in the project, you could join our sponsoring team. We welcome partial funding contributions as small as $20,000 per year. You support is appreciated. Feel free to contact us if you want to discuss about funding and other opportunities.
